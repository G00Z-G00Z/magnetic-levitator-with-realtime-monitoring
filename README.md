# Magnetic levitator with real time monitoring

A magnetic levitator that controls the height of a metallic ball in and
communicates with a server in real time. These would allow to send information
to the magnetic levitator from a remote server 

# Structure

The structure of the entire system is the following: 

- `Microcontroller`: Handles the real time algorithm that controls the levitation of the magnetic ball. It receives commands from the `computer` and it also sends the data generated by the controller. 
- `Computer`: Handles sending and receiving information to the `microcontroller` and the `server`. It acts as a bridge between the microcontroller's control system, and the server. It is connected through a serial port with the controller and talks to the server using web sockets
- `Server`: It handles a web socket server that sends information to the `client app` and the `computer`
- `Client-app`: It sends information to the `server` to control the `microcontroller`, and graphs the response of the system.
